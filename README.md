# ðŸš— Self-Driving Car Using NVIDIA's End-to-End CNN Model

This project implements a **self-driving car** using **NVIDIA's Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model**. The original code was taken from **Sully Chen's GitHub** (TensorFlow 1.x) and updated to **TensorFlow 2.x**. The model was trained on a **2.2 GB dataset**.

## ðŸš€ Features
- Uses **NVIDIA's CNN architecture** for autonomous driving.
- **Updated from TensorFlow 1.x to 2.x** for compatibility.
- **Trained on 2.2 GB dataset** for accurate lane and steering predictions.
- Supports **real-time inference** for self-driving simulation.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
- The dataset used is **2.2 GB** and consists of recorded driving behavior.
- If needed, you can collect your own dataset using **Udacityâ€™s self-driving car simulator**.
